This file finishes the part of Stage 4 that the earlier council-integrity file
left open.

`CouncilIntegrity.lean` already proves that reachable states preserve unique
member identifiers, that current-round vote identifiers are distinct, that
current-round votes belong to seated members, and that stored vote rounds stay
within the active deliberation round.  Those are the integrity facts that the
no-stuck theorem needed.

The remaining public statement is about change over time.

Two properties matter here.

First: seated membership is monotone.  A successful public step may leave the
seated roster unchanged or shrink it, but it never restores a non-seated
member to `seated`.

Second: when the engine records a new council vote, that vote comes from a
member who was seated in the source state.  This is a state-to-state theorem,
not only a theorem about the final stored record.

`continueDeliberation` never rewrites the stored vote list.

The function may close the case, advance the deliberation round, or leave the
case in the same round.  In every branch it keeps the stored vote list exactly
as it found it.

`continueDeliberation` never rewrites the council roster.

Replacing one member status with a non-seated value can only shrink the seated
roster.

This is the status-monotonicity fact the public theorem needs.  The update may
remove the targeted member from the seated roster.  It cannot add a new seated
member, because the only changed status is explicitly non-seated.

Every successful public step can only shrink the seated roster.

Most public actions do not touch the council roster at all.  The removal
action is the only one that can change it, and it changes one seated member to
an explicitly non-seated status.

This is the monotonicity theorem that the verification plan called for.
Starting from any source state, later successful public steps may remove seated

A successful council-vote step introduces only a seated current-round vote.

This is the step-local statement behind the larger public theorem below.  The
engine records exactly one new vote, that vote belongs to the current source
round, and its member was seated in the source state.

Every successful public step introduces new council votes only from seated
members in the source state.

Most public actions do not add votes at all.  The council-vote action is the
only exception, and the engine admits that step only after checking that the
member is seated in the source state and has not already voted in the current
round.
