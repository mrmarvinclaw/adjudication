This file proves the arithmetic fact behind the cumulative material limits.

The engine stores admitted exhibits and technical reports in append-only lists.
The policy then places side-level caps on those lists.  The dynamic property we
want is simple to state: if the current state already respects the side caps,
and if the next batch of materials belongs to one side and still fits within
that side's remaining budget, then appending the new materials preserves the
caps.

This theorem is more useful than a sample check and more tractable than an
immediate theorem about the whole `step` function.  It isolates the exact
counting argument that later step-level proofs will need.

Appending one side's new materials preserves the cumulative side caps.

The theorem uses explicit role-uniformity assumptions for the new material
lists.  That is deliberate.  The arithmetic fact should not depend on how the
lists were produced.  It says: once the incoming exhibits and reports all
belong to one side, and once the caller has shown that side's new totals fit
within the policy, appending those lists preserves the full bilateral limit
invariant.

The lemmas below lift the arithmetic fact into procedure-level invariants.

`appendSupplementalMaterials_preserves_material_limits` proves the counting
argument itself.  The remaining work is structural.  Most transition helpers do
not touch the admitted-material lists at all.  The proofs make that explicit.

That distinction matters.  If a later edit breaks the invariant, the failure
should point to one of two precise causes: either the append arithmetic was
wrong, or a transition unexpectedly changed the material lists.
