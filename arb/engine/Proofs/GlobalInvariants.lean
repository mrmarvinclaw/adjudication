This file lifts the local proofs into state invariants.

The earlier files proved three kinds of facts.

First, initialization produces the intended starting state.

Second, `phaseShape` summarizes the merits sequence, and `proceduralParity`
extracts the fairness meaning of that structure.

Third, the admitted-material caps are preserved when one side appends a batch
of exhibits and reports that still fits within the remaining budget.

The next step is to connect those facts to `Reachable`.  That means proving two
things about successful transitions:

1. The filing sequence remains well-formed.
2. The cumulative exhibit and report caps remain respected.

This file begins with the structure lemmas that the full induction needs.

Successful initialization starts in the opening-shape state.

Initialization does not merely set `phase := "openings"`.  It also clears all
later filings.  That combination is exactly the opening branch of `phaseShape`.

Successful initialization also starts with empty admitted-material lists.

`initializeCase` clears `offered_files` and `technical_reports`.  Because the
side-level limits are natural-number upper bounds, empty lists satisfy them
immediately.

Appending supplemental materials does not affect the filing shape.

`phaseShape` depends only on the merits lists and the current phase.  The
append function changes neither.

Adding an opening to a well-shaped opening state preserves the global shape.

There are only two live opening configurations.

If no opening exists, the added filing must be the plaintiff's, and the case
remains in the `openings` branch of `phaseShape`.

If one opening exists, that opening must already be the plaintiff's.  The new
filing is the defendant's, and the case advances to `arguments`.

Adding an argument preserves the filing shape.

The opening phase is already complete when arguments begin.  The argument list
is therefore either empty or contains the plaintiff's single argument.  The new
filing keeps the case in `arguments` or advances it to `rebuttals`.

Adding the single rebuttal advances the case to surrebuttals.

The rebuttal branch of `phaseShape` states that the rebuttal list is empty.
The first plaintiff rebuttal therefore completes the whole phase.

Adding the single surrebuttal advances the case to closings.

The surrebuttal branch mirrors rebuttal.  The list is empty before the filing.
After one defendant surrebuttal, the case opens the closing phase.

Adding a closing preserves the global shape.

The closing branch is the second bilateral phase after the optional filings.
As with openings and arguments, the list is either empty or contains the
plaintiff's closing.  The second closing moves the case to deliberation.

Passing the rebuttal opportunity preserves the shape and advances the phase.

The rebuttal branch of `phaseShape` already says the rebuttal list is empty.
Passing therefore changes only the phase marker.

Passing the surrebuttal opportunity preserves the shape and advances the phase.

The same reasoning applies one phase later.  The surrebuttal list is still
empty, so the pass changes only the phase marker.

`stateWithCase` preserves any case-level invariant already proved for the new case.

The helper increments `state_version` and swaps in the supplied case.  It does
not transform the case again.  For `phaseShape`, the proof is therefore direct.

/--
Closing a deliberating case does not disturb the merits structure.

The `deliberation` and `closed` branches of `phaseShape` impose the same
requirements on openings, arguments, rebuttals, surrebuttals, and closings.
The only difference is the phase label itself.  Once the case reaches
deliberation with the full merits sequence complete, closing it preserves the
same structural fact.

`continueDeliberation` preserves the merits structure.

This function decides whether the current votes already determine the outcome,
whether the remaining seated members are too few to reach the required vote
threshold, whether the round should advance, or whether deliberation should
continue in place.  None of those branches rewrite the merits filings.

The proof is therefore a case split on the same four possibilities.  The only
nontrivial branch is closure, where the phase changes from `deliberation` to
`closed`.  `closeDeliberation_preserves_phaseShape` isolates that fact.

`continueDeliberation` preserves the cumulative material limits.

Deliberation changes vote state, council seating, round number, status, phase,
and resolution.  It never rewrites `offered_files` or `technical_reports`.
That makes the proof simpler than the filing-shape version above.  Every branch
reduces to `stateWithCase_preserves_material_limits` with reflexive equalities
for the material lists.
