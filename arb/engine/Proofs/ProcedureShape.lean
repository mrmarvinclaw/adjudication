This file proves a fairness property at the engine boundary.

The earlier proof files described the linear merits sequence with sample steps.
This file moves one level outward, to `nextOpportunityForPhase`.  That function
decides which side may act next.  If it allocates the optional phases
incorrectly, no later runner logic can repair the procedure.

The two claims below are the core of the optional-phase fairness rule.

First: when the case is in rebuttals, the only live opportunity belongs to the
plaintiff.  The defendant never receives a rebuttal opportunity.

Second: when the case is in surrebuttals, the only live opportunity belongs to
the defendant.  The plaintiff never receives a surrebuttal opportunity.

The engine also treats those phases as single-turn opportunities.  Once the
relevant list is nonempty, `nextOpportunityForPhase` returns a terminal result
for that phase instead of offering a second turn.

The file also connects the abstract phase-shape predicate to a simpler fairness
invariant over counts.

`phaseShape` says much more than parity.  It describes the whole merits
sequence, including which later lists must still be empty in each phase.
`proceduralParity` extracts the part that matters for bilateral fairness: in
openings, arguments, and closings, the defendant is never ahead of the
plaintiff and neither side has more than one filing; rebuttal remains a single
plaintiff filing; surrebuttal remains a single defendant filing.

That theorem matters because later proofs can use the smaller invariant without
carrying the full phase machine everywhere.

The structural phase predicate implies the simpler fairness invariant.

This theorem compresses the engine's full sequence predicate into the facts a
reader usually wants first.  At every well-shaped point in the merits process:

1. In openings, arguments, and closings, the defendant never has more filings
   than the plaintiff, and neither side has more than one filing.
2. Rebuttal remains plaintiff-only and at most once.
3. Surrebuttal remains defendant-only and at most once.

The theorem does not say that `phaseShape` is unnecessary.  The stronger
predicate still carries the full sequence order.  It says that the stronger
predicate entails a clean fairness summary.

In rebuttals, an empty rebuttal list yields exactly one live plaintiff
opportunity.

The theorem states the precise contract exposed by the engine: the role is
`plaintiff`, the phase is `rebuttals`, the opportunity may be passed, and the
allowed tools are exactly rebuttal submission and phase pass.
