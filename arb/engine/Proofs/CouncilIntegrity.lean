This file establishes the basic integrity of the deliberation record.

Stage 3 of the verification plan asks for a liveness theorem: every reachable
non-closed state has a next opportunity.  The deliberation branch of that
theorem needs one concrete fact that the earlier files did not state.

If a deliberation round is still live, the stored current-round votes should
describe distinct council members who are still seated in the case.  Otherwise
the arithmetic test in `continueDeliberation` would not line up with the
search performed by `nextCouncilMember?`.

The first half of the file proves those integrity facts for every reachable
state.  The second half derives the one consequence that Stage 3 needs:
whenever a live deliberation state has not yet completed the round, the engine
can still find a seated council member who has not voted in that round.

Removing an unvoted seated member preserves deliberation-record integrity.

The repair to `removeCouncilMember` forbids removal after a current-round vote.
