This file begins Stage 3 of the verification plan: a reachable non-closed case
should not become stuck without a next opportunity.

The proof has two different parts.

For the merits phases, the result is mostly structural.  `phaseShape` already
states the exact filing prefixes that are permitted in openings, arguments,
rebuttals, surrebuttals, and closings.  The operational question is then
simple: do those shapes line up with what `nextOpportunityForPhase` actually
returns?  The answer should be yes.

Deliberation is different.  There the engine computes the next actor from the
stored vote list and the seated council roster.  The earlier files therefore
proved two separate invariants: council identifiers remain unique, and the
current-round votes stay well formed.  Those are the facts this file needs to
turn "the round is still live" into "some seated council member has not yet
voted."

The first theorem batch here proves the direct operational helpers that the
later no-stuck proof will reuse.

/--
A validated policy requires a positive decision threshold.

The deliberation liveness proof needs a simple arithmetic fact: when the
engine says that too few seated members remain for a decision, the threshold it
compares against is not zero.  That fact comes from `validatePolicy`.

Advancing the deliberation round clears the new current-round vote list.

This is the operational fact behind the round-advance branch of
`continueDeliberation`: the vote list is not rewritten, but every stored vote
belongs to an earlier round.

If a reachable state has closed the phase machine, it has also closed the
status flag.

`nextOpportunity` checks `status` first, while several proof statements talk in
terms of `phase`.  The no-stuck theorem needs those two views to agree on what
it means for a case to be closed.

A started bilateral phase still has a next role.

`plaintiffThenDefendant` is the executable selector for openings, arguments,

the admissible prefixes in those phases.  This theorem says that the two views
agree.

If a deliberation round is not complete, the engine can still identify a next
voter.

The proof is the contrapositive of `nextCouncilMember_none_implies_round_complete`.
That earlier theorem established the hard direction.  This one packages the
forward consequence that the no-stuck theorem will use.

During deliberation, `continueDeliberation` leaves the phase in only two
places: it either keeps the case in deliberation or closes it.

This is the minimal structural fact needed to rule council actions out of the

`pristineCouncilState` depends only on the council roster, the stored votes,

that observation so the action-specific proofs can stay short.

A live result from `continueDeliberation` still has a next council voter.

This theorem isolates the operational content of the deliberation helper.  If
the helper closes the case, the theorem does not apply.  If it returns a live
deliberation state, then one of two things happened.

First: the current round was incomplete, so the helper returned the same case.
In that branch, the existing council-integrity theorem already says that a
seated unvoted member exists.

Second: the round was complete but not final, so the helper advanced the round
counter.  In that branch, the new round starts with no current-round votes.
The only remaining obligation is to show that at least one seated member
remains, which follows from the positive vote threshold and the fact that the
helper did not take the "too few seated members" closing branch.

A reachable live deliberation state still has a next council voter.

Initialization cannot produce deliberation.  The only successful public steps
that can end in deliberation are: the second closing statement, a council vote,
or a council-member removal.  The first case uses the merits-phase invariant to
show that deliberation starts with an untouched council record.  The latter two
cases use the direct `continueDeliberation` theorem above.

Every reachable non-closed state has a next opportunity.

This is the Stage 3 theorem.  It says the engine does not strand a live case.
The proof splits by phase.

For the merits phases, `phaseShape` tells us exactly which filing prefixes are
reachable, and those prefixes line up with the executable selectors in
`nextOpportunityForPhase`.

For deliberation, the previous theorem supplies the next council voter.
