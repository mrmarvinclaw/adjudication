This file states the second global invariant.

The earlier arithmetic proof in `AggregateLimits.lean` showed what must happen
when one side appends a new batch of exhibits and reports that still fits
within the remaining budget.  The step-level proofs then have to connect that
fact to the public engine boundary.

The global theorem is the same pattern as `reachable_phaseShape`: induction on
`Reachable`, with one preservation theorem for each successful public action.

The important point is now global rather than local.  The earlier files proved
the counting argument and then proved each public transition preserves that
argument.  This file closes the loop.  Every reachable state, not just every
sample trace or helper result, respects the cumulative exhibit and report caps.

Every reachable state respects the aggregate exhibit and report caps.
