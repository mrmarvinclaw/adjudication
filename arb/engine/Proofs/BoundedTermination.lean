This file begins Stage 6 of the verification plan: bounded termination.

The proof is not complete yet.  What is complete here is the framework the
final theorem will need:

1. a remaining-step budget for merits and deliberation;
2. an indexed public-run relation that records the number of successful steps;
3. small list facts about phase-local progress; and
4. preservation lemmas showing that merits actions leave the deliberation
   budget unchanged.

That groundwork matters.  The eventual bounded-termination proof should not
reconstruct these definitions inside one long induction.  It should state its
measure once, prove the local decrease lemmas cleanly, and then lift them to
an indexed run bound.

`Reachable` says only that some successful run exists.  Bounded termination
needs the stronger indexed relation below, because the final theorem has to
compare a run length against the initialized budget.

If a list is nonempty, appending one element yields a list of length at least
two.

Merits actions leave the deliberation budget unchanged.

They do not change the stored vote list, the deliberation round, or the
current council roster.  The later bounded-termination proof will use these
lemmas to separate merits progress from deliberation progress.

Away from `closed`, the step budget splits into its merits and deliberation
components.

This rewrite is convenient because the later local decrease theorems will
usually reason about only one component at a time.

The bounded-termination proof needs this arithmetic fact at initialization.

Adding an opening filing consumes exactly one merits step.

`phaseShape` limits a reachable openings list to `[]` or `[plaintiff]`.  The
first opening stays in the same phase.  The second opening completes the
bilateral pair and advances the phase machine to `arguments`.  In either case
the merits budget drops by one.

The total budget splits into a merits component and a deliberation component.

Passing a rebuttal or surrebuttal also consumes exactly one merits step.

The public `pass_phase_opportunity` action is the only successful merits step
that does not add a filing.  It still advances the phase machine, and it still
uses one unit of the fixed merits budget.

Appending a fresh current-round vote consumes exactly one unit of
deliberation budget.

The seated roster does not change.  The current-round vote count increases by
one.  The strict-inequality hypothesis says there was still one unit of round

Changing one seated member to a non-seated status decreases the seated-member

The uniqueness of council identifiers matters here.  It rules out the
possibility that the requested identifier names some other seated member in the

Removing an unvoted seated member consumes exactly one unit of deliberation
budget before `continueDeliberation` runs.

The vote list does not change.  The active round does not change.  The seated
roster loses exactly one member because successful removal forbids both empty
status and the status `"seated"`.

Once `continueDeliberation` receives a deliberating case, it does not increase
the remaining-step budget.

Closing makes the budget zero.  An incomplete round preserves the deliberation
budget exactly.  A completed but non-final round advances the round counter and
therefore leaves at most one full round of budget less than before.

A successful council-removal step decreases the total remaining-step budget by

Successful removal changes one seated member to a non-seated status and leaves

The merits actions decrease the budget exactly by one.  The two council

Successful initialization fixes the starting remaining-step budget at
`8 + max_deliberation_rounds * council_size`.

The merits side contributes eight fixed actions.  Initialization also starts
deliberation in round one with the full council seated and no current-round
votes, so the deliberation budget is exactly the number of full council votes
available across the configured rounds.

Every successful indexed public run from initialization has a fixed explicit
length bound.

This is the public Stage 6 theorem.  If a run starts from successful
initialization and then follows `n` successful public `step` transitions, then
`n` cannot exceed the initialized remaining-step budget.
