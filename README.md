# Agent-driven adjudication

This project is an experimental AI civil litigation system that uses
agent attorneys with either agent or human clients.

The implementation:

1. Uses a core procedural engine implemented in
   [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) with [many
   theorems](adc/docs/proofstats.md) about its behavior.

1. Supports verifiable execution in [attestable instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/nitrotpm-attestation.html) and trusted
   execution environments (TEEs), which also provide confidentiality.
   
1. Roughly follows the [United States Federal Rules for Civil
   Procedure](https://www.uscourts.gov/rules-policies/current-rules-practice-procedure/federal-rules-civil-procedure)
   (FRCP).  Our version of the rules is called the [Agent Rules
   for Civil Procedure](adc/docs/ARCP.md) (ARCP).

1. Interacts with agent attorneys via an implementation of the [Agent
   Client
   Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/get-started/introduction)
   extended to support external tool calls for litigation.  Currently the agents are implemented by [`pi`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/tree/main). This
   approach facilitates arbitrary computer use by attorney-agent teams.
   
1. Provides somewhat sophisticated [sampling for candidate pools of AI
   jurors](adc/docs/juries.md).  (Attorneys still have access to *voir dire*
   under [ARCP](adc/docs/ARCP.md) [Rule
   47](adc/docs/ARCP.md#rule-47-selecting-jurors).)

We are starting to use this system as a simulator to use in developing
agent attorneys and judges.


## Overview

This repo contains two adjudication systems in one repository and one Go module.  [Agent District Court](adc/) models U.S. Federal District Court procedure, including pleadings, discovery, motions, jury selection, trial, verdict, and reporting.  [Agent Arbitration](arb/) models arbitration before a council, with a smaller procedural surface and a shorter path to decision.

Lean defines the procedural engines and the proof surface for both systems.  Go builds the command-line tools, storage layer, prompt assembly, report generation, provider clients, and ACP integration.  The repository root exists to keep those shared parts together; the day-to-day build and run entrypoints remain in `adc/` and `arb/`.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `adc/` | District-court system, including the Lean engine, Go runtime, examples, and reports |
| `arb/` | Arbitration system, including the Lean engine, Go runtime, examples, and prompts |
| `common/` | Shared Go packages, provider and ACP integration, personas, `xproxy`, the PI container build path, and repository tools |
| `go.mod` and `go.sum` | Root Go module for shared packages and both runtimes |

The two systems share infrastructure but remain separate applications.  `adc/` builds `adc` and `adcengine`.  `arb/` builds `aar` and `aarengine`.  Shared code lives under `common/`, not in a sibling checkout outside the repository.

## Requirements

This repository builds with Go `1.25` and Lean `4.27.0` with `lake`.  `make` drives the project-specific targets in `adc/` and `arb/`.  The Python tools in `common/tools/` are `uv` scripts and should run that way.

Live runs require Podman, network access to the configured model providers, and the corresponding API keys.  The checked-in district-court demo uses ACP attorneys through `xproxy`, so `OPENAI_API_KEY` is required and some model pools also require `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.  Arbitration examples use the same shared provider and ACP path where the selected models require it.

## Build And Run

The repository root has no top-level `Makefile`.  Build, test, and proof commands run from `adc/` or `arb/`, depending on which system you are working on.  The normal entrypoints are these:

```bash
cd adc && make build && make test && make prove
cd arb && make build && make test && make prove
```

The main live example for `adc/` is `make demo`, which signs the example materials, drafts the complaint, and runs the full case in `adc/out/ex1-demo/`.  The main live examples for `arb/` are `make demo`, `make ex2`, and `make ex3`, each of which drafts a complaint and writes a complete run packet under `arb/out/`.  Both systems produce a digest, a transcript, an event log, and a machine-readable run record for each completed run.

Use the system-specific READMEs for the procedural details and the full command surface.  The district-court documentation is in [Agent District Court](adc/README.md).  The arbitration documentation is in [Agent Arbitration](arb/README.md).
